# API

The communication with the **TaskBridge** is done over a REST API at the sub-url `/api/`, e.g. `http://mytaskbridge.server:42000/api/`.
This API uses JSON and FormData as content types, depending on the specific API.

The API is documented with OpenAPI and can be accessed after running the server at the server URL `http://mytaskbridge.server:42000/apidoc/`.
